# TicTacToe With MiniMax Algorithm

* Implemented alpha beta pruning.
* It cares about TicTacToe depth.
* You can play with any size of boards. But AI is only useful for 3x3 board.
* Player Vs Player works with any board but Player Vs CPU only works with 3x3 board.

# Something people can try:

* Make MiniMax Algorithm to work with bigger boards (Current algorithm is so slow for other boards).

# Build

* Just get dotnet core from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download and just navigate to the project folder and do `dotnet run`.

# End
